## Projects

#[Project 1: Defi Token Farm | Guided](https://github.com/erikmacinnnis/DefiTokenFarm)
* Followed a guided Youtube video to create an simple yield farm application built for the EVM 
* The application allows users with the MockDai Token to lend their MockDai in return for DappToken 
* The application consist of four following Smart Contracts:
* Two basic token smart contracts, one smart contract for functionality of the Token Farm, and a basic Migrations smart contract from trufle configuaration.
* JS script that gives the owner the ability to issue tokens
* JS migration file that loads both Tokens and the TokenFarm to the Ganache Blockchain, as well it sends 100 MackDai to a user and 1 million DappToken to the TokenFarm
* JS file to test all the functionalities of the smart contracts
* The application interface was created using React and Web3 

#[Project 2: Open Auction | Unguided](https://github.com/erikmacinnnis/Auction/edit/main/README.md)
* This is an solidity contract that can be used to run an open auction
* It includes one smart contract written in Solidity to maintain all the functionality of the Auction
* Owners of the auction can determine the beneficiary and length of the auction
* They can also easily determine the minimum starting bid
* Users can withdraw their bids at any time

#[Project 3: Bidirectional Map | School Project](https://github.com/erikmacinnnis/Bidirectional-Map)
* This is a Map made up of Rooms (nodes) which are connected together via north, east, west, and south gates.
* I created a Room class that is composed of an all the rooms and an iterator to loop over a Room type with an enhanced for loop.
* I created the BidirectionalMap class which extends the MazeMap class. This class creates and links multiple rooms to create the map.
* I created the saveToFile method in the MazeMap class which saves all the possible rooms and gates accessible in the Maze.
* I created the noKeySolution method in the MazeMap class which finds a route from the start to finish of the maze using a recursive helper function I created called findNextRoom.
* The rest of the project was created by the professor
